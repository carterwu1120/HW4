        <p>This data involves students using Dynamic Composite Physicalizations to enhance learning performance.</p>
        <p>Dynamic composite physicalizations refer to a category of physical visualizations that use self-propelled objects in collections to represent data.
            These visualizations can embody well-known interactive visualization techniques and explore novel visualizations and interaction paradigms.</p>
        <b>Figure 1 illustrates the distribution of students' scores in Mathematics, English, and Science.</b>
        <p>The grade distribution of these 3 subjects do not show obvious difference.
            When each subject doesn't display a concentrated distribution, it suggests that there isn't a significant gap in the students' levels across those subjects.</p>

        <b>Figure 2 illustrates the ratio of male to female students.</b>
        <div id= "myGraph2"></div>
        <b>Figure 3 illustrates the distribution of students' ages.</b>
        <p>The age distribution closely resembles a Normal distribution, with most students being around 22 years old. This suggests that the participants might be senior college students.</p>
